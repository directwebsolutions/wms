# WMS 3.0
THIS IS A WIP SCRIPT AND IS STILL BEING DEVELOPED AT THIS TIME
Website Management Software

WMS version 3.0.0 is designed to replace the difficult PHP back end for web developers and allow them to focus on what they do best - Make pretty websites. With WMS you can create template files in html and inject variables into them on runtime with ease by simply calling `%%VAR1%%` and incrementing the 1 up to add multiple variables. This also allows variables to be reused with easy, along with templates.

Another major feature in WMS v3 is full language support. As a developer, you can now easily translate your code using language callbacks and then translating from file using a language object. We have been working hard to add themes as well!

Don't want to code the user experience portion? No worries! WMS comes with a built in user registration system, login and permissions system, user banning, statistics, and more! Save the tedious integration methods - with WMS you can be up and running with a few lines of easy to copy code and have a secure, fast, and robust back end system ready for addons, themes, and more!
